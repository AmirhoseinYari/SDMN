If namespaces were on the different servers :
Again it's so similar to figure2, despite the fact you need each node a route rule like figure2, you only need to add routeing rules for
packets to the real eth that communicates to outside world, just like how docker does.

(node namespaces have the same rules.)

server 172.0.0.0/24 rules : (send each packet in the correct direction.)
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev eth1
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev br1

server 10.10.0.0/24 rules : (send each packet in the correct direction.)
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev eth2
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev br2
