If namespaces were on the different servers :
Again it's so similar to figure2 and you only need to route packets to the real eth that communicates to outside world, just like how docker does.

server 172.0.0.0/24 rules :
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev eth1
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev br1

server 10.10.0.0/24 rules :
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev eth2
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev br2
