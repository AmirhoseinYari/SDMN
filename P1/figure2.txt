Obviously if we delete the router and links between bridge nodes, different subnets can't ping eachother.
The reason is that there isn't any link between bridges and you must add routing rules in root namespace
for solving the problem, also you need to route packets to the other subnet inside each node namespace, too.

routes for root : (send each packet to the bridge corresponding to the subnet.)
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev br2
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev br1

routes for each node : (send packets to the bridge interface.)
ip netns exec node1 ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev veth-1
ip netns exec node2 ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev veth-2
ip netns exec node3 ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev veth-3
ip netns exec node4 ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev veth-4
